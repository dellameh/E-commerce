Multi-agent Marketplace Simulation:
This code models an agent-based e-commerce marketplace simulation, where buyer and seller agents interact within a grid environment to make purchasing decisions based on dynamic factors like price, budget, and distance. Buyer agents evaluate available sellers and make transactions, while seller agents manage inventory, set prices, and occasionally restock. The system tracks transactions and simulates market behavior over time.
